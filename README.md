# Study No. 1 for AI Ensemble (2021)

![An excerpt from the composition](https://github.com/kureta/film/raw/master/images/score-excerpt.png "Åžahin Kureta - Study No. 1 for AI Ensemble (2021) (excerpt)")

I trained a bunch of AI instruments/performers based on the [DDSP](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp) architecture by the Magenta team at Google,
then composed for an ensemble of those AIs.
The composition is constructed in [December.ipynb](https://github.com/kureta/film/blob/master/December.ipynb) notebook.
Graphical score was created using numpy.
Final render of the score follower video is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT73XTeWyMo).


I am currently working on a real-time, 48kHz, Pytorch implementation of the model [here](https://github.com/kureta/performer).
